# tilr-interview

## Added changes:

-Login and signup prompts that hash password.
-Basic question answering by user.

## Issues:

-Was only able to create cookie once, and have had issues making cookies work since.
-Was able to test answering questions by checking relationship with an already created user id.

## Next Step:

-Next step would have been to create percentages based on user responses to questions.
-Once cookies were created I intended to hide the questions behind user logins, forcing the user to be signed in.
